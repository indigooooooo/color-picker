Color Picker Tool

This Python script allows you to click on any point on your screen and get the RGB and HEX color values of the pixel you clicked.

This will only work on your main monitor, will update once I've found the problem with secondary monitors not outputting


You do not need everything in the zip, just download the .exe if you want that.

- Hit the Green Code Button, click "Download ZIP"
- Extract the downloaded folder, go into the "dist" folder, and open PokéCordAutoCatcherx.x.exe
- Thats it :)

Made to grab color codes for another script I'm working on, honestly might not be much support, thank you for using either way <3
